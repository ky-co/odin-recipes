    <h3 class="header">Description</h3>
    <p class="text">This is a recipe for my favorite food, curry chips, or curry fries if you are from the US.
        They are chips/french fries covered in a curry sauce and melted cheese.
        They are extremely popular in Ireland and can be thought of as a kind of Irish poutine.

    <h3 class="header">Ingredients</h3>
        <p class="text">For the sauce:

            <li>1 tbsp tomato puree</li>
            <li>salt and pepper (to taste)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup golden raisins (optional)</li>
            </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        For the chips/fries, I would recommend using frozen steak fries.
    </p>
    <h3 class="header">Steps</h3>
    <p>
        <ol class="text">
            <li>While prepping the sauce, throw the chips/fries on a pan and throw them in the oven.</li>
            <li>Prepare the spice blend for the sauce. In a small bowl or ramekin add the curry powder, turmeric, cumin, ground coriander seed, and cinnamon.</li>
            <li>Add the oil to a large skillet over medium to high heat.  Add the onions and sauté for 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Next, add the peeled and diced apple to the pan and sauté for another 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Toss in the minced garlic and ginger.</li>
            <li>Mix the spices and onions together as they cook for another minute.</li>
            <li>Flour is my sauce thickener of choice. Cook it over medium heat for 2 minutes, scraping the bottom of the pan as you combine the mixture completely.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the stock while you constantly stir the mixture to prevent lumps from forming. Scrape the bottom of the pan as you mix everything together. Bring it to a boiling point, then reduce the heat so the sauce is just simmering.</li>
            <li>I add a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce, not a typical curry requirement.</li>
            <li>Add the tomato paste and two teaspoons of sugar.  Season with salt and pepper and mix everything together. Simmer the sauce for 15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
            <li>Before blending turn the heat off under the pan and allow the sauce to cool a little. When ready pour the sauce into the blender and blitz until smooth (1 to 2 minutes depending on how powerful your blender is).</li>
            <li>Return the sauce to the pan and turn the heat back on. </li>
            <li>Then you’re ready to serve your spicy sauce with perfectly golden chips or fries.</li>
        </ol>
